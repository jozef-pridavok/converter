THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The App connects to the following external services ONLY to fetch currency
exchange rates:

1. exchangerate.host
   Purpose: Fetch fiat currency exchange rates (USD, EUR, etc.)
   Data Sent: API request for current exchange rates

through our servers, and we do not log or store any information about these
requests.

DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

Local Storage

- All user data is stored locally on your device using Hive (a secure local
  database)
